# Web-Progrmaming-PHP-Movie-Theatre

This is a project that was made in the Fall of 2013 for CSC309 (Web Programming).

The project uses PHP and MySQL running on an Apache server to emulate an online movie theatre ticket ordering application.

It is no longer being worked on and is left here for reference.
